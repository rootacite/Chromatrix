 * keeps the newest-step-first order the rest of the section uses, so a pinned card never jumps
 * around when another checkpoint is saved. A pinned path that matches no checkpoint (Reset deleted
 * its weights) is simply not drawn — the pin stays in the file, where it can still be removed.
 *
 * The section is checkpoint-driven — an image always belongs to the checkpoint its save wrote — so
 * a job is attached by the checkpoint it names, and the step is only the fallback for a record that
 * names none. A step whose checkpoint is gone keeps its row, so Reset (which deletes weights and
 * keeps samples) never hides images, and any generated image a card did not claim lands in a
 * `samples only` row rather than nowhere at all.
